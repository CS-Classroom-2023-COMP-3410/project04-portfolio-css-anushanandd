The project was pretty straightforward. I first made the css file and changed the visual elements such as font and colors. Then, I made more specific changes to each site that I thought made the site nicer visually, but also practically for responsiveness. I implemented slideshows for the photos in the home page and gallery for smaller devices as opposed to the user having to scroll down to see all the pictures. I had small problems with ChatGPT as it made some silly suggestions such as having fonts only be for a specific page but also problems with centering and allignment. I made sure to include a hamburger layout menu/navbar and also made the images responsive to ensure everything fit on the screen. I used the FireFox tool to check how the site looked on every media size (phone, tablet, laptop).
